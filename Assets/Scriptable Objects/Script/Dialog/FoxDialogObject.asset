  - '*Gasp*'
  - Hello stranger, I'm just a magical fox who lives in this forest.
  - Last night, I had an epiphany.
  - That someone unusual would come to this place.
  - And save us.
  - From what, you may wonder?
  - For thousands of years, this kingdom had been living in peace.
  - Until one day, the witch of darkness showed up.
  - She destroyed the royal army and took over the king.
  - Ever since, her magic has been constantly spreading and plunging everything in
    darkness.
  - This forest is one of the last places that have yet to be infected.
  - Thanks to the ancient magical power of the spirit of the forest.
  - But the witches' monsters are destroying the forest, weakening the spirit.
  - So you can see the darkness is slowing seeping at the edge of the forest.
  - So, the chosen one. Can you help us?
  - Here's a few tips to help you.
  - At the top left of the screen is your health bar. It indicates the amount of health
    you have.
  - If you run out of health, you will die. But don't worry, killing monsters can
    drop health potion.
  - Next, at the bottom left of the screen lies a joystick that helps you in any direction
    you point to.
  - 'A chosen has three action: Attack(A), Skill(S), Ultimate(S). They vary among
    chosens.'
  - Attack is the basic way of attacking. It doesn't cost mana. But it has a timer
    between attacks.
  - You need to wait until the timer depletes to attack again.
  - Skill and Ultimate are two special skills that make one a chosen.
  - They also have a cooldown between usage, but the cooldown is much longer than
    attacks' timer.
  - And they cost mana to use.
  - That's all you need to know by now. Now embark, chosen!
